## About the Game

In **Dynamic World Changer**, you jump between parallel dimensions where gravity, platforms, and enemies all behave differently. One moment you're on solid ground; the next, you're falling upwards. Think of it as solving a Rubik's Cube on a rollercoaster ðŸŽ¢â€”challenging, but fun.

### Features

- **Dimension Shifting**: Hop between realities with a single pressâ€”no DeLorean required.
- **Physics-Bending Puzzles**: Solve puzzles where gravity and platforms shift with the dimensions ðŸ¤¯.
- **Dynamic AI**: Enemies adapt to different dimensions, with some becoming relentless and othersâ€¦ less so.

> Pro Tip: Donâ€™t get too comfortable in one dimensionâ€”itâ€™s likely to change.
